# Tetris

A three week long team project to design and implement a moderately sized Tetris game application using C# and Visual Studio. 
Team size of 12. I contributed mainly as a team leader, designing a working game with UML diagrams and documentation, 
delegating work assignments, ensuring deadlines are met, coding game functionality and tests, reviewing code, and fixing any bugs 
to ensure a polished product.
